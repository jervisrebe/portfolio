*Hell pizza visuals*

To bring out the playfulness of the Hell brand we focussed a lot on incorporating animations throughout the app. 

Animation is also a great way to focus the user on what is important on screen, while providing visual grandeur. This in turn meant we needed to be careful to not take away from other important aspects on screen.

Below are some examples of the animations.
